# Loops, conditions and parsing

This project serves as an introduction to advanced syntax and semantics in shell
scripting such as loops, conditions, and parsing. The objectives for this project
are to know:

- How to create SSH keys.
- What the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash` is.
- How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops.
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements.
- How to use the `cut` command.
- What files and other comparison operators are, and how to use them.
